this project deals with Monom and Polynom.
*Monom: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomial
*Polynom: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial

Monom has 7 main function:
1) constructor, recives two numbers: 'a' Double 'b' Integer and build a Monom with coefficient a and power b.
2) derivative, recives a Monom and returns the derivative. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative)
3) f function, recives real number 'x' and returns the value of the Monom at - 'x' point.
4) is zero, returns if the the Monom equals to - 0 or not.
5) String constructor, recives string from user and converts it to Monom type.
6) add, recives Monom and add it to another Monom only if the degrees are equal.
7) multiply, recives Monom and multiply it to another Monom, by multiply the coefficient and adding the degree.

Polynom has 13 main function:
1)
