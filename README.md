this project contains the objects - 
*Monom: an expresion consisted of coefficient - a, x , and the degree of - x, such as: 3x^2
*Polynom: sum of monoms with different coefficient and degree, such as: 3x^2 + 2x + 5
in the project there are some functions on Polynom and Monom such as: add, subtract, multiple, root, derivative and etc.
